# The point of this script is one thing: it tests the built .app's payload from a directory
# OUTSIDE the repo. Every bug that reached a release did so because verification happened inside
# the repo, where the environment is quietly more forgiving than a real install:
#
#   - `node server.js` run from .next/standalone resolves require() upward into the repo's own
#     node_modules, so packages missing from the bundle still loaded. linkedom and sqlite-vec
#     shipped broken this way ("Module not found") and passed local testing every time.
#   - `swift build` run against helper/ in the repo passed while the bundled copy was missing
#     Package.swift entirely.
#   - Checking that a directory exists says nothing about whether the package inside it can load.
#
# So: copy what the app actually ships, put it somewhere with no parent node_modules, and use it.
