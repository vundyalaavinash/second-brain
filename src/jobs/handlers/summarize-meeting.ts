/**
 * Four more fields were tried here and taken back out: owner and deadline on each action, plus
 * risks and open_questions, to match the meeting template this app is modelled on.
 *
 * Measured on the same transcript, repeatedly, widening the schema made every field worse. The
 * model filled owner and deadline zero times out of two while still writing "By end of week, for
 * Priya" into `notes` -- it had the information and would not put it where it was asked. risks and
 * open_questions came back empty, and decisions dropped from one to zero: asking for seven things
 * cost the one it had been getting right.
 *
 * So the schema stays narrow, which is what the local 7B model can actually do. Owner and deadline
 * are better confirmed by a person when accepting an action as a task -- which is what the source
 * material asks for anyway ("repeat the ask, owner, deadline"): a confirmation step, not an
 * extraction problem.
