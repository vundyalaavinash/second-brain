          file. Nothing here asks where it belongs yet — everything captured lands in the Inbox, unfiled, until you decide.

      <Topic title="Organize — Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive">
        <p className="m-0">
          Everything you keep lives in one of four kinds of place, split by what it&apos;s for rather than what it is:
        </p>
        <ul className="pl-5 m-0 flex flex-col gap-1 list-disc">
          <li><strong className="text-fg font-medium">Projects</strong> have an end — something you&apos;re working toward finishing.</li>
          <li><strong className="text-fg font-medium">Areas</strong> don&apos;t end — a standard you maintain for as long as it matters.</li>
          <li><strong className="text-fg font-medium">Resources</strong> are reference material — notes and links you&apos;re keeping for later, not acting on now.</li>
          <li><strong className="text-fg font-medium">Archive</strong> is where a closed project or a dead area goes, out of the way but never deleted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="m-0">
          <strong className="text-fg font-medium">Library</strong> is the catalog of everything, filterable by type, status, tag, date,
          or which of the above it&apos;s filed to.
        </p>
      </Topic>

      <Topic title="Planner">
        <p className="m-0">
          Day and Week views for time-blocking: drag a task onto the timeline to give it a slot, or let <strong className="text-fg font-medium">Fill the day</strong> place
          your open tasks into whatever&apos;s actually free. The capacity line at the top counts down real minutes left today —
          accounting for meetings, and for how long things have actually taken you before, not just your estimate.
        </p>
        <p className="m-0">
          A <strong className="text-fg font-medium">Focus run</strong> (<Kbd>⌘</Kbd> <Kbd>⇧</Kbd> <Kbd>F</Kbd>) times a single sitting on one
          task, so the planner learns from what really happened, not what you guessed.
        </p>
      </Topic>

      <Topic title="Goals">
        <p className="m-0">
          Set a goal for the quarter or the year, then link the projects and tasks that move it. Progress is computed from what&apos;s
          actually done among the linked work — never a number you type in by hand. A goal that hasn&apos;t moved in a while is called
          out as stalled, so it can&apos;t quietly drop off your radar.
        </p>
      </Topic>

      <Topic title="Weekly Review">
        <p className="m-0">
          A short guided ritual to close the loop on the week: what finished, what&apos;s carrying over, and what you&apos;re walking
          into next. Your answers are searchable afterward, the same as any other note.
        </p>
      </Topic>

      <Topic title="Meetings">
        <p className="m-0">
          Meetings get recorded automatically when they start, or on demand with <strong className="text-fg font-medium">Record now</strong>.
          Each one carries a local decision — <strong className="text-fg font-medium">Going</strong>, <strong className="text-fg font-medium">Maybe</strong>,
          or <strong className="text-fg font-medium">Not going</strong> — that decides whether it blocks your calendar and counts against
          your day&apos;s capacity. This decision is only ever recorded here; it&apos;s never sent to the organizer or the calendar
          server.
        </p>
        <p className="m-0">
          File a meeting to a project from its own page, or from the project&apos;s Meetings section. The{" "}
          <strong className="text-fg font-medium">Audit</strong> page shows what a recurring series has actually cost over the last 90
          days — occurrences, hours, attendance, and what came out of it — as plain facts, deliberately with no score or ranking.
        </p>
      </Topic>

      <Topic title="Distill">
        <p className="m-0">
          For notes, links, and files: once something has gone quiet for a while, the app tries to boil it down to a short gist and a
          handful of key quotes pulled directly from what you wrote — never invented, never paraphrased into something you didn&apos;t
          say. You choose <strong className="text-fg font-medium">Keep</strong> or <strong className="text-fg font-medium">Not useful</strong>;
          either way, your original note is never touched.
        </p>
        <p className="m-0">
          This runs fully offline and does nothing until a small local model is set up — no account, no ongoing cost. Browse everything
          you&apos;ve kept from Library&apos;s Distilled filter.
