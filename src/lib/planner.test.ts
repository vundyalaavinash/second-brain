// `meetingSeriesDecisions` as unconditionally current. Declining a long-running series therefore
// re-rendered every occurrence from months ago as "Not going": opacity-dimmed, hidden behind the
// default filter, captioned "This is your record, not a reply" on an hour that already happened,
// while the meeting audit (reading the same rows through `effectiveDecisionAsOf`) still reported
// the old attendance. Two surfaces asserting opposite facts about the same hour.
