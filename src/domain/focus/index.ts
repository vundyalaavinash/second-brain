 * - Under `ABANDON_UNDER` minutes is a mis-click, not work: it is abandoned whatever it was
 *   called, and books nothing.
 * - Past the run's planned end by more than `STALE_AFTER`, the run closes at the end it was
 *   *meant* to have, as "completed", regardless of how late the caller's own clock reads — a
 *   laptop that slept mid-run and woke ten hours later must book the same minutes whether the
 *   stale run was found by a background read (`runningFocus`) or by the tab finally posting its
 *   finish. After this there is no way, through any exported function, to book more than
 *   `plannedMinutes + STALE_AFTER` against a task.
 * - An explicit `"abandoned"` always wins over staleness: design §4.1 defines abandoned as ended
 *   under two minutes in *or discarded by the person*, and a person who comes back and discards a
 *   run they left running must still get 0 minutes booked, however late that discard call
 *   arrives. The staleness override above is only for a caller with no opinion, or one asking for
 *   `"stopped"`/`"completed"` — it is not license to overrule an explicit discard.
 * - "completed" means the clock reached zero, so it books exactly `plannedMinutes` — never a
 *   rounded wall-clock figure, so an on-time finish a few seconds late does not round up past
 *   what was planned. "stopped" keeps the rounded wall-clock time: that is what "ended early with
