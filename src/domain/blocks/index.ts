/**
 * What the day is already spoken for: timed meetings the person is actually going to (or has not
 * yet said otherwise about), and every session on it a live task holds. A dropped task gives its
 * hours back — `dropTask` takes its sessions away, and this skips them besides, so a row left
 * behind by an older write or by a hand-edited database never blocks a slot.
 *
 * A meeting blocks exactly the minutes `meetingCost` charges it against the capacity line, not
 * its whole clock length: the capacity figure and the scheduler must never disagree about the same
 * hour, and `meetingCost` is the one rule that decides what an hour of meeting actually costs.
 * That falls out to three behaviours, all of them `freeMinutes`'s own, none of them restated here:
 * a `going` meeting blocks its full length; a `not-going` meeting — regardless of what the
 * calendar's own RSVP still says — costs nothing and so blocks nothing, its zero-length span
 * dropped before it reaches `freeSlots`; a `maybe` meeting costs half, so it blocks half, leaving
 * the back half of the hour placeable. Before this the `maybe` case was the one disagreement left:
 * the hour was blocked whole while capacity reported half of it free, so "Fill the day" could
 * leave a genuinely available half-hour unplaced.
 *
 * The blocked half is taken from the *start* of the meeting, which is also what keeps a `maybe`
 * sitting on top of a `going` meeting from freeing anything: its half span falls inside the going
 * meeting's own, and `freeSlots` merges them — the same "an overlapping maybe adds nothing over
 * time already fully spoken for" rule `freeMinutes` reaches through `outsideCover`.
 *
 * `effectiveDecision`, not `effectiveDecisionAsOf`, and this is *not* because a day still being
 * planned has no past occurrence to protect — it can, once a meeting already under way is being
 * scheduled around, and an earlier version of this comment claimed otherwise (second final
 * whole-branch review, priority 2/6). `setMeetingDecision` guarantees an already-started
 * occurrence always carries its own explicit `decision` override the moment a series decision is
 * made *from that occurrence itself* — so for the row someone actually declined from,
 * `effectiveDecision` and `effectiveDecisionAsOf` agree regardless of `decidedAt`, which is what
 * this file relies on. That guarantee does not reach a *sibling* occurrence of the same series
 * that is also already under way but was not itself decided from: if the decision was made from a
 * different, not-yet-started occurrence instead, an under-way sibling keeps no override, and the
 * two resolvers can still disagree on it exactly as they did before this fix (recorded in
 * `docs/superpowers/follow-ups.md`, not fixed here — narrower and rarer than the case this fix
 * closed, since it needs two occurrences of the same series in progress or straddled by `now` at
 * once). Plain `effectiveDecision` is used here because it needs no series-decidedAt data at all,
 * not because the two functions are guaranteed to agree in every case.
