  // `db/client.ts`'s `path.join(process.cwd(), "drizzle")` is a dynamic path nft can't statically
  // resolve, so the tracer falls back to sweeping in large swaths of the project root (desktop/,
  // including its multi-GB Rust build directory; helper/, but only partially -- see below) for
  // entries that transitively import it. This config is kept because it correctly filters the
  // *.nft.json trace files themselves (verifiable after a build: grep them for "desktop/"), but
  // -- found the hard way, after it silently stopped mattering -- `next build` defaults to
  // Turbopack, and Turbopack's standalone copy step does not consult this filtered result, so it
  // is NOT sufficient by itself to keep desktop/ out of .next/standalone. The actual fix is the
  // mandatory `rm -rf .next/standalone/desktop` in desktop/README.md's build steps, run after
  // every build. Ballooned a shipped release from ~120MB to over 5GB before that was caught.
  //
  // `helper/` (the Swift activity tracker and meeting recorder) isn't part of the server's module
  // graph at all -- it's built and invoked by scripts/brain.sh as separate binaries -- yet the same
  // fallback picked up its .swift source files (never Package.swift, never .build). Rather than
  // depend on tracer behavior for a directory it was never meant to reason about, desktop/README.md
  // copies it explicitly and completely instead, alongside public/ and .next/static. The partial
  // copy this left behind is exactly what broke `swift build`: "could not find Package.swift".
